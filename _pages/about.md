Cas Li is an Asian-American lyricist, librettist, director, actor, and writer based in the Greater Boston area. Currently vice-president of Harvard’s nationally-recognized Asian Student Arts Project (ASAP), Cas is a sophomore at Harvard College studying a joint concentration in Computer Science and Theatre, Dance & Media.

Cas has been extremely active in Harvard’s extracurricular theatre scene. As an actor, they performed in ASAP’s all-Asian production of Legally Blonde: The Musical, which received national recognition in fall 2021. In spring 2022, they performed in the Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert and Sullivan Players’ The Milk Made; or, The Friend of Anarchy, a groundbreaking Asian-American rewrite of G&S’s culturally insensitive The Mikado, receiving international recognition. 

Cas recently directed ISCARIOT: THE MUSICAL, a queer and Asian adaptation of the biblical tale of Judas and Jesus, which received regional and national recognition.

Cas also wrote and directed 52!: A Statistics Cabaret, a jukebox musical following the life of a queer statistician from industry to academia, inspired by their own experiences as a femme-presenting person in STEM.

Cas is currently working on the book, lyrics, and music for while True, an original musical that centers authenticity in a bid to understand what it means to be human in the face of world-changing artificial intelligence technologies.

As a theatremaker and writer, Cas is particularly interested in exploring the in-betweens, especially the intersections of politicized identities. They also enjoy creating art that makes audience members question their stake in the consumption of their work, spurring action in pursuit of a more equitable and just world.
