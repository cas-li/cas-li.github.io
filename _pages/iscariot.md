ISCARIOT: THE MUSICAL re-imagines Judas Iscariot as a queer Asian American high school senior who falls in love, betrays his best friend, and learns to take control of his own narrative. Set in a glitzy high school in modern-day Hollywood, with a diverse musical score incorporating pop, rock, and folk elements, ISCARIOT is a new interpretation of the Biblical canon and a commentary on race, class, and celebrity culture.

Played at Agassiz Theatre December 1-4, 2022. More to come!
